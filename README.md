### Project Overview

I created a headphone e-commerce app that offers a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. With an attractive banner, a responsive navbar that hides on scroll, and organized category tiles, users can easily navigate the platform. The app highlights special offers, features detailed product pages, and provides a seamless shopping process, including real-time notifications. Cart management is intuitive, and the app is designed to be responsive across various devices, ensuring a consistent experience. The incorporation of a robust routing system and Sanity schema enhances efficiency and scalability.
